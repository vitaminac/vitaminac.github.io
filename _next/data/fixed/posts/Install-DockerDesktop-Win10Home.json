Docker Desktop cannot be installed directly. But in fact, the home version can activate Hyper-V by script to install Docker Desktop. Here's how to do it.\n\n## Activate Hyper-V\n\nThe method is very simple, save the following as a .cmd file, then open the file as an administrator. Prompt to restart, and then you can use the full-featured Hyper-V after the restart.\n\n    pushd \"%~dp0\"\n\n    dir /b %SystemRoot%\\servicing\\Packages\\*Hyper-V*.mum >hyper-v.txt\n\n    for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:\"%SystemRoot%\\servicing\\Packages\\%%i\"\n\n    del hyper-v.txt\n\n    Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /LimitAccess /ALL\n\n## Fake as a professional version to bypass installation detection\n\nSince Docker Desktop will detect the system version at the time of installation, direct installation will show that the installation failed. So you need to change the registry to bypass the installation detection. Execute the following command.\n\n    REG ADD \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v EditionId /T REG_EXPAND_SZ /d Professional /F\n\n## Other issues\n\nInstall the [docker-ce-desktop-windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) directly on the official website, and uncheck the window container during installation. After testing, the linux container is running normally. Switching to the windows container will detect the windows version and will not start. However, the windows container is generally not used.\n",
