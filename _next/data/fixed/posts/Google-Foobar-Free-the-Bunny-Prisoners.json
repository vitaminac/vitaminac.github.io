We know that these $\\text{num_required} - 1$ bunnies cannot open the door by themselves and hence the remaining $\\text{num_bunnies} - \\text{num_required} + 1$ bunnies must have a key that these $\\text{num_required} - 1$ bunnies don't. We have total [$\\binom{\\text{num_buns}}{\\text{num_required} - 1}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) combination of each $\\text{num_required}- 1$ bunnies pair, so we have also [$\\binom{\\text{num_buns}}{\\text{num_required} - 1}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) distinct keys. And there should be $\\text{num_buns} - \\text{num_required} + 1$ copies of each distinct key among the bunnies.\n\nNote that $\\binom{\\text{num_buns}}{\\text{num_required} - 1} = \\binom{\\text{num_buns}}{\\text{num_buns} - \\text{num_required} + 1}$\n\nThus, for the example of N = 5 and M = 3, there are $\\binom{5}{3 - 1}$ distinct keys (10 keys).\n\nWe must distribute $5 - 3 + 1$ copies of all $10$ keys amongst the bunnies in such a way that any 3 bunnies we pair together have, amongst them, at least one copy of every key.\n\n1. we count number of distinct keys we have with formula $\\binom{\\text{num_buns}}{\\text{num_required} - 1}$.\n2. Find the number of copies per key $\\text{num_buns} - \\text{num_required} + 1$.\n3. Yield combinations of keyholders one at a time, and we give key to each keyholder.\n\n[Free The Bunny Prisoners](https://github.com/vitaminac/code/blob/master/competition/foobar/Free_The_Bunny_Prisoners.py)\n\n## Reference\n\n* [Combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination)\n* [Pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)\n* [Google Foobar Round 4](https://surajshetiya.github.io/Google-foobar/#round-4)\n* [foobar_4-1_free_the_bunny_prisoners.py](https://github.com/FoxHub/Google-FooBar/blob/master/Level-4/foobar_4-1_free_the_bunny_prisoners.py)\n* [鸽笼原理](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75478415)\n* [4.1_bunny.py](https://github.com/arinkverma/google-foobar/blob/master/4.1_bunny.py)\n"
