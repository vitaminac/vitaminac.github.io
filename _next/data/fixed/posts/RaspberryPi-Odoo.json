To correctly install Docker Compose V2 we need to install it with `su` user.\n\n### Run Prestashop from Docker\n\n[MySQL docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) and [Prestashop docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/prestashop/prestashop/) don't provide support for `armv7l`. [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) provides support for `arm64`. However, [Raspberry Pi OS is 32 bits](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/101216), you can verify with `uname -m` that kernel is built for `armv7l`. Although [Raspberry Pi is working on 64 bits OS beta version](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=275370), the better alternative now is to use [alpine-prestashop](https://hub.docker.com/r/yobasystems/alpine-prestashop/) and [alpine-mariadb](https://hub.docker.com/r/yobasystems/alpine-mariadb/).\n\nExecute following commands\n\n    cd ~\n    [ -d prestashop ] || mkdir prestashop\n    cd prestashop\n    curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vitaminac/851e2caa9337b31568844cfe53ef6806/raw/fffde01a2e826630ed1c8f95b32c4586359a7053/raspberry-pi-prestashop-docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml\n    sudo docker compose up\n\n### Complete Installation\n\nOpen http://localhost:8080 you will see the installation page of Prestashop, follow the instruction and complete the installation. In the **System configuration** you need to adjust the setting according to the environment variables of docker compose file.\n\n* Database server address: **mysql**\n* Database name: **prestadb**\n* Database login: **prestauser**\n* Database password: **prestapass**\n* Tables prefix: leave it as default\n* Drop existing tables: leave it as default\n\nAfter the installation is completed you need to delete the `install` folder with following command\n\n    sudo rm -rdf $(sudo docker volume inspect $(sudo docker volume ls | grep prestashop-php | awk '{print $2}') | grep Mountpoint | awk '{print substr($2, 2, length($2) - 3)}')/install\n\nNow you can access your front office of your Prestashop with http://localhost:8080 and back office with http://localhost:8080/admin4365218asd897fasd54f78asdf57/index.php.\n\n## Configure Odoo\n\n    sudo docker run -p 8069:8069 mahood73/rpi-odoo\n\n## Reference\n\n* https://gist.github.com/vitaminac/851e2caa9337b31568844cfe53ef6806\n* https://gist.github.com/vitaminac/a69d692f774bc0f37075371c1ace77c3",
