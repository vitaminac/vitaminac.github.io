          There is a special class of distributed data stores that characterized
          by the <strong>lack of simultaneous updates</strong>, most of the
          operations involve reading data. These data stores offers a very
          <strong>weak consistency model</strong>, called
          <strong>eventual consistency</strong>. Eventually consistency means in
          the absence of updates all replicas converge toward identical copies.
          Eventual consistency essentially requires only that updates are
          guaranteed to propagate to all replicas. It is often acceptable to
          propagate an update after some time, and then the question is how fast
          updates should be made available to read-only processes. Concurrent
          update are often relatively easy to solve when
          <strong
            >assuming that only a small group of processes can perform
            updates</strong
          >. Eventual consistency is therefore often
          <strong>cheap to implement</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Client-centric-consistency-models">
          <a
            href="#Client-centric-consistency-models"

            title="Client-centric consistency models"
          ></a
          >Client-centric consistency models
        </h2>
        <p>
          Eventual consistent data stores work fine
          <strong>as long as clients always access the same replica</strong>.
          However, problems arise when different replicas are accessed over a
          short period of time. Assume the user performs several update
          operations and then disconnects again. Later, he accesses the database
          again, possibly after moving to a different location or by using a
          different access device. At that point, the user may be connected to a
          different replica than before. If the updates performed previously
          have not yet been propagated, the user will notice inconsistent
          behavior. In particular, he would expect to see all previously made
          changes, but instead, it appears as if nothing at all has happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          By introducing special client-centric consistency models, the previous
          problem can be alleviated in a relatively cheap way. In essence,
          client-centric consistency provides guarantees for a
          <strong>single client</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To explain these models, we consider a data store that is physically
          distributed across multiple machines. When a process accesses the data
          store, it generally connects to the nearest available copy, although
          any copy will be possible. All read and write operations are performed
          on that local copy. Updates are eventually propagated to the other
          copies. To simplify matters, we assume that data items have an
          associated owner, which is the only process that is permitted to
          modify that item. In this way, we avoid write-write conflicts.

        <p>
          Let $x_i[t]$ denote the version of data item x at local copy $L_i$ at
          time $t$. $x_i[t]$ is the result of a series of write operations
          denoted as $WS(x_i[t])$ at $L_i$ that took place since initialization
          until time $t$. If the same operations have been replicated at local
          copy $L_j$ at a later time $t_2$, we write $WS(x_i[t_i];x_j[t_2])$. If
          the ordering of operations or the timing is clear from the context,
          the time index will be omitted.

          >Monotonic Reads
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a <strong>monotonic-read consistent</strong> data store, if a
          process reads the value of a data item x, any successive read
          operation on x by that process will always return that same value or a
          more recent value.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example where monotonic reads are useful, consider a distributed
          email database, when a user open mailbox in San Francisco and notice a
          new email is present. When the user later flies to New York and opens
          his mailbox again, monotonic-read consistency guarantees that the
          messages that were in the mailbox in San Francisco will also be in the
          mailbox when it is opened in New York.
        </p>
        <p><img src="monotonic-reads.png" alt="Monotonic reads examples" /></p>
        <p>
          In the figure (a), process $P$ first performs a read operation on $x$
          at $L_1$ shown as $R(x_1)$, returning the value of $x_1$. This value
          results from the write operations $WS(x_1)$ performed at $L_1$. Later,
          $P$ performs a read operation on $x$ at $L_2$, shown as $R(x_2)$. To
          guarantee monotonic-read consistency, all operations in $W(x_1)$
          should have been propagated to $L_2$ before the second read operation
          takes place. In other words, we need to know for sure that $WS(x_1)$
          is part of $WS(x_2)$, which is expressed as $WS(x_1;x_2)$.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the figure (b), shows a situation in which monotonic-read
          consistency is not guaranteed. After process $P$ has read $x_1$ at
          $L_1$. it later performs the operation $R(x_2)$ at $L_2$. However,
          only the write operations $WS(x_2)$ have been performed at $L_2$. No
          guarantees are given that this set also contains all operations
          contained in $WS(x_1)$.

          >Monotonic Writes
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a <strong>monotonic-write consistent</strong> data store, a write
          operation by a process on a data item $x$ is completed before any
          successive write operation on x by the same process. In other words,
          no matter where that operation was initialized, for each node the new
          write of same process must wait for old write propagate to local copy.
        </p>
        <p><img src="monotonic-writes.png" alt="Monotonic writes example" /></p>
        <p>
          In the figure (a), a process $P$ performs a write operation on $x$ at
          local copy $L_1$. Later, $P$ performs another write operation on $x$,
          but this time at $L_2$. To ensure monotonic-write consistency, it is
          necessary that the previous write operation at $L_1$ has already been
          propagated to $L_1$. This is why we have $W(x_1)$ at $L_2$ and before
          $W(x_2)$.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the figure (b), in which monotonic-write consistency is not
          guaranteed. What is missing is the propagation of $W(x_1)$ to copy
          $L_2$. By the definition of monotonic-write consistency, write
          operations by the same process are performed in the same order as they
          are initialized.

        </h3>
        <p>
          In a <strong>read-your-writes consistent</strong> data store, the
          effect of a write operation by a process on data item $x$ will always
          be seen by a successive read operation on $x$ by the same process. In
          other words, a write operation is always completed before a successive
          read operation by the same process, no matter where that read
          operation takes place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Read your writes consistency is useful when updating web documents and
          subsequently viewing the effects.

        <p><img src="read-your-writes.png" alt="Read your writes" /></p>
        <p>
          In the figure (a), process $P$ performed a write operation $W(x_1)$
          and later a read operation at a different local copy. Read-your-writes
          consistency guarantees that the effects of the write operation can be
          seen by the succeeding read operation. This is expressed by
          $W(x_1;x_2)$, which states that $W(x_1)$ is part of $WS(x_2)$
        </p>
        <p>
          In the figure (b) $W(x_1)$ has been left out of $WS(x_2)$, meaning
          that the effects of the previous write operation by process $P$ have
          not been propagated to $L_2$.

        <p>
          In a <strong>writes-follow-reads consistent</strong> data store, a
          write operation by a process on a data item $x$ following a previous
          read operation on $x$ by the same process is guaranteed to take place
          on the same or a more recent value of $x$ that was read. In other
          words, any successive write opeartion by a process on a data item will
          be performed on a copy of $x$ that is up to date with the value most
          recently read by that process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writes-follow-reads consistency can be used to guarantee that user can
          only post a reaction to an article only after they have seen the
          original article.

        <p><img src="writes-follow-reads.png" alt="Writes follow reads" /></p>
        <p>
          In the figure (a), a process reads $x$ at local copy $L_1$ and the
          value is also propagates to $L_2$, where the same process later
          performs a write operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the figure (b), no guarantees are given that the operation
          performed at $L_2$, because the write operation is performed on a copy
          that doesn’t receive the update that is on the $L_1$.
